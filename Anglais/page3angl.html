                <h2>What is Speedcubing ?</h2>
                <article class="article" id="p3art1"> 
                    Speedcubing is the word used to describe the discipline of solving a Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. What started out as a simple puzzle, challenging anyone who tried to solve it, is the source of what speedcubing is today. Those who managed to solve it quickly sought to improve and solve it faster, in order to set challenge themselves. Nowadays, speedcubing is a growing discipline, involving more and more people of all backgrounds and ages, with numerous competitions held all over the world throughout the year.

                <h2>How can we improve ?</h2>
                <article class="article" id="p3art2">
                    As you can imagine, Rubik's Cube solvers do not all have the same level. How can we explain such a difference in solving time between a person who normally solves it in more or less 3 minutes, a beginner in Speedcubing who will be aiming at solving it in less than a minute, an intermediate who will take less than 30 seconds, and an advanced level person who will always do it in less than 10 seconds?
                    <ul>
                        <h3>Choosing a cube</h3>
                        <li>The choice of the cube is a very important criteria, since it's the main tool you use, and it's therefore essential that it performs as well as possible. Indeed, many a beginner must have struggled trying to first solve a Rubik's Cube quickly, and the reason is that it's not really made for that: the cube tends to get stuck quite easily. That's why brands specialized in Speedcubing have developed their own cubes which aim to perform much better, offering us cubes which suit better to the discipline.</li>
                        <h3>Choosing a method</h3>
                        <li>When you're a beginner, the method you learn is always pretty much the same, and it's often a simple one, requiring you to learn just 4 or 5 algorithms, i.e. 4 or 5 sequences of moves. However, this is far from being the most efficient, as it requires you to be in very specific conditions in order to solve the cube. That's why the most frequently used methods are much more time-consuming (the most classic requires learning over 75 algorithms), but also much faster, since the solution is known for each case.</li>

                <h2>From a more personal point of view</h2>
                <article class="article" id="p3art3">
                    <p>Personally, I see speedcubing above all as a hobby. This discipline is a way for me to overcome boredom in any situation just by having this little object with me. That said, it's also a way of pushing my limits by challenging myself. Always trying to improve is motivating and pushes me to always try to learn more.</p>
                    <p>Although I wouldn't say that I'm a good speedcuber, I did manage to get personal best of just over 14 seconds, which I'm satisfied with. However time isn't the only thing that drives me to keep improving, and I often try to set myself new challenges, the latest being to solve a cube blindfolded.</p>
